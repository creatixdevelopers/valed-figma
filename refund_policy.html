					<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>To purchase a program you would be redirected to our payments partners’ link for which a successful payment will help enrol the
						candidate in the program. Despite the standard prices listed at our website, we occasionally run promotions and sales for our
						content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the
						content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for
						particular content may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t
						registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.</p>
					<p>The prices visible to you would be in our home currency. We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies. The price
						doesn’t include any exchange rates, bank rates that are charged etc. Depending on your location, the price you see may include
						such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout</p>
					<p><b>Refunds</b></p>
					<p>If the course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 15 days of your purchase of the course,
						that Val-Ed India apply a refund to your account. We reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to
						your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment processing partners, the platform
						from which you purchased your course and other factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 15-day guarantee
						time limit has passed. However, if a course you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled
						to a refund beyond this 15-day limit. If in the 15 day period the child has attended sessions, a refund for that would not be
						initiated. Val-Ed India also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 15-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed
						account fraud.</p>
					<p>If we decide to issue refund credits to your account, they will be automatically applied towards your next course purchase on
						our website, Refund credits may expire if not used within the specified period, and have no cash value.</p>
					<p>At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant portion of a
						course that you want to refund or if you’ve previously refunded a course, we reserve the right to deny your refund, ban your
						account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your access to a course due to your
						violation of these Terms or our Trust & Safety Guidelines, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.</p>
					<p>You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process
						other means of for those fees. Val Ed India works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment
						methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure. We may update your payment methods using information
						provided by our payment service providers</p>
					<p>When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you
						still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within seven (7) days of
						notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any content for which we have not received adequate
						payment.</p>
					<p><b>Refunds and Refund Credits</b></p>
					<p>If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 15 days of your purchase of the content,
						that Val Ed India apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to Subscription Plan purchases.</p>
					<p>We reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion,
						depending on capabilities of our payment service providers, the platform from which you purchased your content and other
						factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 15-day guarantee time limit has passed. However, if the content
						you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 15-day limit.</p>
					<p>At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant portion of the
						content that you want to refund or if you’ve previously refunded the content, we reserve the right to deny your refund,
						restrict you from other future refunds, ban your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your
						account or disable your access to the content due to your violation of these Terms or our Trust & Safety Guidelines, you will
						not be eligible to receive a refund.</p>
					<p><b>Free Demo & Renewals</b></p>
					<p>Your program course may start with a free trial or demo which is not chargeable and is solely designed to give the student the
						experience of the class before signing up and to avoid refunds, cancellations, discrepancies, difference in expectations and
						more. The duration, timing and session length of the free trial demo will be specified during sign-up. Val Ed India determines
						free trial eligibility at our sole discretion and may limit eligibility or duration. We reserve the right to terminate the
						free trial and suspend your subscription if we determine that you aren’t eligible, fraud or bad intent.</p>
					<p>After completion or near termination of program, we will send you the renewal details for you to renew at your liberty but, if
						we are running any promotions or offers, if the purchase is made within the stipulated time period only then the discount or
						price will be locked upon else the standard prices will be applicable.</p>
